--- abstract

This document details mechanisms created for performing Remote Attestation
that have been used in a number of industries.  The document intially focuses
on existing industry verticals, mapping terminology used in those
specifications to the more abstract terminology used by RATS.

The document (aspires) goes on to go on to describe possible future
use cases that would be enabled by common formats.
